# use the training log as a shared heartbeat that is visible to any host:
#
#   (a) If the log file contains a "[iter NNN] FINISH ... rc=<N>" line,
#       the training has definitively ended — mark completed (rc==0) or
#       failed (rc!=0). run_experiment.sh's bg block writes this line
#       unconditionally right after python3 exits.
#   (b) Else if the log mtime is stale beyond REAP_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT seconds
#       (default 900 = 15 min, well beyond the ~10 min loop period and any
#       reasonable eval-only stall), assume the training died without
#       finalizing — mark completed with the current timestamp.
#   (c) Else, the log is fresh — leave the row as `running`. (Also, as a
#       fast path, if /proc/<pid> is alive locally we skip (b) and (c).)

You are in autoresearch loop mode. Iteration $ITER_PAD just finished training.

YOUR TASK: Analyze this single experiment per program.md §4 (mandatory visualizations) and §5 (log format).

CRITICAL ORDERING (write skeleton FIRST so timeout doesn't lose all work):
1. Read state/user_summaries.md and state/user_summary.md FIRST if they exist, then program.md, CLAUDE.md, last 3 logs/iteration_*.md, state/iterations.tsv. Treat user summaries as the user's highest-priority steering notes unless they conflict with HARD CONSTRAINTS.
2. Parse metrics from runs_autoresearch/<exp_name>/<subdir>/final.pth (torch load, ckpt['metrics']).
3. **WRITE logs/iteration_$ITER_PAD.md NOW** with §1-§4 + §6 verdict + §7 + §8 filled
   (use metrics from step 2; per_class.csv content can be sketched from prior knowledge or
   marked "TBD pending viz"). This is the SKELETON — must exist on disk after step 3.
4. **Update state/iterations.tsv NOW** (set \$2=analyzed, \$9=best_h, \$10=verdict). The
   defensive guard checks for the .md file's existence; once steps 3+4 are done, even if
   the rest times out, this iter is preserved.
5. Generate the 4 mandatory visualizations into figs/iter_$ITER_PAD/ — per_class.csv first
   (most informative for verdict), then gamma_sweep.png, then tsne.png, then attn.png last
   (heaviest, can be skipped if running short on time).
   IMPORTANT — VIZ GPU SELECTION: viz scripts auto-pick the least-loaded GPU when
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES is unset (skipping GPU 0 by default). Do NOT hard-code CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES.
   Copy per_class_delta_iter*.py from an existing one to inherit the auto-pick block.
6. Re-edit logs/iteration_$ITER_PAD.md §5 to fold in actual viz takeaways (replacing TBD).
7. Append a new "### Iteration $ITER_PAD" subsection to CLAUDE.md's "Documented findings" with a 1-paragraph lesson.
8. Exit (don't propose next experiment; the next loop tick handles that).

HARD CONSTRAINTS from program.md §HARD CONSTRAINTS still apply. No git push. Do not touch projects outside this repo's working tree.

You are in autoresearch loop mode. It's time to propose iteration $NEXT_PAD.
$CONSENSUS_HINT
YOUR TASK: Propose ONE new experiment targeting SUN H improvement, create its config, and launch it via run_experiment.sh.

STEPS (in order):
1. Read state/user_summaries.md and state/user_summary.md FIRST if they exist, then program.md completely, then CLAUDE.md, then all files in logs/iteration_*.md (may be none on first iter). Treat user summaries as the user's highest-priority steering notes unless they conflict with HARD CONSTRAINTS or binding consensus guidance.
2. Review state/iterations.tsv for what's already been tried and their verdicts. IMPORTANT: rows with status="running" are currently training on other GPUs — treat them as "already taken" and do NOT duplicate their hypothesis. Pick something different.
3. Look at the "Exploration frontier" in program.md and the "Documented findings" in CLAUDE.md. Pick ONE hypothesis to try. Prefer high-priority items that haven't been tested yet and aren't currently running. You may propose something new if well-justified.
4. Create a new config at configs/ablation/iter${NEXT_PAD}_<short_name>.yaml. Its output_root MUST be under runs/. Base it on configs/cifar10_resnet34.yaml (or whatever your project's baseline config is) unless your hypothesis requires otherwise. Change ONE thing (or a small coherent set of things belonging to one mechanism).
5. If your change requires modifying code (src/<your_pkg>/*.py or train.py), do it now. Make the change targeted, not sweeping.
6. Launch via: bash run_experiment.sh configs/ablation/iter${NEXT_PAD}_<short_name>.yaml $NEXT_ITER
7. After the launch script returns, STOP. Do NOT wait for training to finish. Do NOT analyze. Those happen in subsequent loop ticks.

HARD CONSTRAINTS from program.md §HARD CONSTRAINTS still apply.
