# git_iter_commit.sh — Auto-commit one iteration's analysis to a per-iter branch.
#
# Called by loop.sh's analyze step after claude -p completes its iteration_NNN.md.
# Workflow:
#   1. Switch to (or create) branch "autoresearch/iter-NNN"
#   2. Stage all changes (config + report + viz + CLAUDE.md edits + state.tsv row)
#   3. Build a structured commit message using metrics from final.pth + iteration_NNN.md
#   4. Commit (no merge; AUTO-PUSH by default since AUTORES_GIT_AUTOPUSH defaults to 1 — set to 0 to keep branch local)
#   5. Switch back to main without merging
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/git_iter_commit.sh <ITER_NUM>
#
# Env:
#   AUTORES_GIT_AUTOPUSH=1 — also push the branch to origin (default: 1 / push enabled)
#   AUTORES_GIT_REMOTE=origin — remote name to push to (default: origin)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = commit OK (or nothing to commit, which is also OK)
#   1 = bad usage / git error / iteration metadata missing

# PREV_BRANCH is HARDCODED to main, NOT inferred from HEAD.
#
# Why: HEAD drifts. If a prior iter's commit step pushed to autoresearch/iter-N
# and never returned HEAD to main (push fail, kill -9, etc.), the next iter's
# `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` returns autoresearch/iter-N. Then the new
# branch `autoresearch/iter-(N+1)` is created off iter-N (not main), AND when
# we restore the working tree at the end, we restore to iter-N rather than to
# main, leaving HEAD permanently drifted. Once that happens, every subsequent
# iter compounds the drift, and `git push origin autoresearch/iter-(N+M)`
# fails with "src refspec ... does not match any" because the local ref was
# never created — the commit is orphaned.
#
# Bug history: 2026-04-26 16:40 in Hysyn-ZSL-v3-SUN-autoresearch — iter009
# committed as f61e74a but no autoresearch/iter-009 ref existed; manual
# `git update-ref` recovery + PR #9 needed.
PREV_BRANCH="main"

# git_checked: run a git command and HONOR its exit code.
#
# Why this exists: the original script piped every git invocation through
# `2>&1 | tail -1 | sed ...` for cosmetic logging. Bash pipelines propagate
# the LAST command's rc (sed's, which is always 0), so `git checkout -b
# BRANCH main` would silently fail on a dirty working tree, leave HEAD where
# it was, and the script blissfully continued — committing iter NNN onto
# the previous iter's branch and never creating refs/heads/BRANCH. The
# `git push origin BRANCH` step then died with "src refspec BRANCH does
# not match any" and the per-iter PR was lost.
#
# Bug history: 2026-04-26 17:01 (Hysyn-ZSL-v3-SUN-autoresearch iter010,
# repeating the iter009 16:40 incident). Manual `git update-ref` rescue +
# PR #10 needed. Reflog showed `checkout: moving from iter-008 to iter-008`
# — the `-b iter-009 main` checkout had been refused and ignored.
#
# This wrapper: runs git, captures stderr to a temp file, uses the real
# rc, mirrors stderr to driver.log, and exits the entire script on
# failure. Cosmetic single-line tail still happens for stdout.
